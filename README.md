# Workday-Scheduler

## Description

The objective of this project was to develop a calendar application that will be used as a daily task planner. This application allows the user to 
add tasks to specific times of the work day and then save them to local storage. It also incorporates colour codes indicating if the task is past, currently on-going or in the fututre. 
This application was built to enable very busy individuals plan their 
workday to avoid missing out on important tasks.

This project was challenging and enabled me to learn certain concepts in jQuery such as DOM traversal and the "this" reference.

## Mock-up

The following image displays the functionality of the application:
